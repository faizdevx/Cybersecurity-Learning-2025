## INTRODUCTION TO CYBER SECURITY 

### cybercrime ?? 

defination

-when someone uses computer,mobiles,internet todo something illegal

origin

-The Case: "Phreaking" by John Draper (a.k.a. Captain Crunch)

--A specific tone called 2600 Hz was used to reset a phone line

--A toy whistle inside Cap’n Crunch cereal boxes could produce a sound exactly at 2600 Hz.

--Draper discovered this and used the whistle to trick the phone system.

### information security(InfoSec)

protecting data(passwords,files,photos,company secrets) is known as information security 

used this to prevent hacking,data theft,identity fraud,financial loss,damage to reputation

cyber attacks done by black hat hackers

#### how infosec works/ how info protected?

3 principals[CIA TRIAD]

-confidentiality(encrypt)
-Integrity(no change in marks at end)
-Availability(you should access your email any time)

methods

-passwords & 2FA
-Encryption
-Firewalls 

example of it ( insta log in and insta account)


### who are cyber criminals

individual or group of individuals do something illegal on internet then those termed as cyber criminals

types of cyber criminals

1) black hat hackers
2) insiders
3) hacktivists
4) cyber terrorists
5) scammers & phishers 

main goal

1) take money 
2) take data
3) spy 
4) identity theft 

### classfication fo cybercrimes

4 categories

1) cyber crimes against individuals

phishing,email spoofing,online stalking 

2) cyber crimes against property 

crime that damaged or attack digital property

hacking,malware/viruses,data theft

3) cyber crime against govt

4) cyber crime agains business



based on techniques 

1) social engineering attacks

tricks people to give them confidential info

phishing vishing smishing pretexting batining

2) network attacks

target the infrastructure(internet/network)

Dos(denial of service) overloading of server
DDoS(same) but from many computers at once
Man in the middle(MITM) intercepting data between two systems
Sniffing capturing data packets on network 
port scanning scanning pc to find weak ports to exploit

3) application based 

SQL INJECTION ( injecting code into website to access into database)

Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)- injecting malicious scripts into webpages

Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF)-triciking users into doing actions unknowingly

File Inclusion Attacks- loading harmfull fiels onto websites/server

### global cyber offences

1) malware attacks

Using malicious software (viruses, worms, ransomware) to damage or control systems worldwide.

2) Online Financial Frauds

Targeting global banks, crypto platforms, and individuals for money.

3) Phishing & Social Engineering

4)  Hacking & Data Breaches

5) terrorism

6) Cyber Espionage(spy on other countries)

7) Cyber Propaganda & Misinformation

8) Child Exploitation & Dark Web Crimes

### how to plan a attack 

1) Information Gathering

Find out as much as possible about the target

OSINT,Scanning into systems,Social Engineering 

A hacker may look through a company’s website to find employee names, email addresses, or any exposed software versions that might have vulnerabilities.

2) creating tools

Develop or obtain the tools needed for the attack.

build malware,purchase tools , craft phishing schemes

3) launching attack

DDos,exploit vulnerabilites,email phishing 

4) exploitation of access

administrator access

5) Installation – Set up backdoors for persistent access

6) Command & Control – Remote control of the system

7) Action on Objectives – Steal data or cause damage

8) Covering Tracks – Erase evidence to avoid detection


### social engineering 

Definition: A technique where attackers manipulate people into revealing confidential information.

Goal: Exploit human behavior instead of technical flaws.

Examples:

Phishing emails (fake bank notices)

Impersonating IT staff to get passwords

Urgent fake messages (e.g., "Your account will be blocked!")

Why dangerous?
Even the most secure systems can be breached if the user is tricked.

### cyber stalking 

Definition: Repeated, unwanted attention or harassment using digital means.

Mediums:

Social media

Emails

GPS/location tracking

Messaging apps

Forms:

Monitoring online activities

Sending threats or abusive messages

Impersonation or spreading fake content

Legal Note: It's a punishable offense under cyber laws in many countries.

### cyber cafe and cyber crime 

Definition: Cyber cafés (public computer access points) have often been used to commit cybercrimes anonymously.

Why it's risky:

No personal device tracking

Easy to log in and disappear

Often lack CCTV or digital logs

Examples of misuse:

Sending fake emails

Uploading illegal content

Performing fraud or identity theft

Control measures:

Mandatory ID checks

Internet activity logs

### Botnets: The Fuel for Cybercrime

Definition: A botnet is a network of infected computers (called bots or zombies) controlled remotely by a hacker.

How it works:

A hacker sends malware to infect many computers.

Once infected, the hacker can use all of them together to:

Launch DDoS attacks

Send spam emails

Steal data from multiple users

Why powerful?
A botnet of 1 million computers can crash entire websites or services!


### attack vectors

The pathways or methods that cybercriminals use to gain unauthorized access to a system or network.

Common Attack Vectors:

Phishing Emails – Tricks users into clicking dangerous links.

Malware Downloads – Through fake software or attachments.

Insecure Wi-Fi – Easy to intercept data.

USB Devices – Malware via pen drives.

Outdated Software – Unpatched systems are easy to exploit.

Brute-force Password Attacks – Guessing weak passwords.

Why it matters:
Understanding attack vectors helps in defending against cyber attacks more effectively.
